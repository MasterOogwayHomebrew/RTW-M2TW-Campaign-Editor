# Reporting a bug

When the game crashes, the tool shows an error, or something looks wrong, please send:

1. **The logs**: in the tool, **Report a bug / Suggest** (bottom right, also Tools -> Report a bug...). Write a few
   words of what happened, add a screenshot if you like (**Add a screenshot...**, or take one with Win+Shift+S /
   PrintScreen and press **Ctrl+V** in the report window), press **Send** - the tool's log, the game's
   `system.log.txt` and the newest REX crash report go to the author at once, no account needed, and you get a
   report number. The author's answer comes back to the editor (see *Answers to my reports* below). When the tool itself shows an error, it offers
   the same window. A long game log is cut to fit: its start (where the game reads the mod's files and says what it
   does not like), every error and warning line of the middle, and its end.
   The editor's log also holds a short picture of the loaded mod (its factions, towns, map size, which files are
   its own - counts and names, no files), so the author sees what the mod is.
   **Anonymous**: before anything leaves, the logs lose your Windows user name (also inside folder paths), the
   computer's name, e-mail addresses, Steam IDs, IP addresses and the player's name of REX's crash report; add
   your own words to hide (your nick). **Show what is sent** shows every line that goes. The contact field is
   optional; with **remember it** ticked (the default) every next report fills it in by itself - it is kept in
   Tools > Settings > Reports too, and unticking it forgets it.
   Rather send it yourself? **Tools -> Save logs (zip)** (or Save as zip in the report window) - the same logs, the
   names cut out, saved in `CampaignEditor_logs` next to the exe.
2. **A video or a screenshot** of what you did and what went wrong.
3. Which game and mod (Rome / REX / BI / Medieval II / M2EX, the mod's name) and the editor's version (in the
   window's title).

Send them as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MasterOogwayHomebrew/RTW-M2TW-Campaign-Editor/issues) or on
Discord. With the logs the cause is usually found and fixed the same day: they name the file, the line and the
game's own error.

Every report - bug or idea - arrives as its own numbered entry with its logs and is read:

![Reports and ideas sent from the editor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterOogwayHomebrew/RTW-M2TW-Campaign-Editor/main/docs/images/reports.png)

## Answers to my reports

The author answers every report - a question ("which picture?"), "fixed in the next build", or why not. You see the
answer in the editor itself: the report window's second tab, **Answers to my reports**. It lists the reports you sent
from this editor, each with its state (open / closed - fixed / closed - not planned) and the talk so far. The editor
looks for new answers when it starts (every few hours), **Check now** looks at once, and the **Report a bug /
Suggest** button says "(1 new)" when one came (the status line says it too).

To reply - answer a question, add details, say "still broken in the new build" - pick the report, write in **Your
answer to the author**, add a screenshot or tick **with the newest logs** if it helps, and press **Send the answer**.
It goes to the same report.

Private: the editor asks only by the reports' numbers (random, known only to you) and gets back only the answers to
them. Switch the start-up look off in Tools > Settings > Reports.

**An idea or a wish?** The same button: pick "an idea", write what the editor should do - it reaches the author
the same way (no logs needed).

**Security problems**: see
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/MasterOogwayHomebrew/RTW-M2TW-Campaign-Editor/blob/main/SECURITY.md) - report
them privately, not in an issue.

## Read the game's log yourself

**Tools > The game's log in plain words** reads the game's newest `system.log.txt` for the mod and explains it: what
crashed, which file and line the game could not read (the line is shown as it reads now) and what to do. If no log
is found, the window says how to switch the game's log on (REX and M2EX keep it on; the original games need two
lines under `[log]` in their preference file).
