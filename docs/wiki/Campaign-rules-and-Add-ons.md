# Campaign rules and Add-ons

## Campaign rules (Tools > Campaign rules...)

![Campaign rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterOogwayHomebrew/RTW-M2TW-Campaign-Editor/main/docs/images/campaign_rules.png)

Every value of the campaign's settings files, by group, each with a plain explanation:

- **Medieval II** - `descr_campaign_db.xml`: recruitment, religion (witches, heretics, inquisitors), bribery, ages and
  the family tree (coming of age, marriage, children, old age), ransom, autoresolve, sacking and siege gear, revolts,
  hordes, merchants, agents' chances, crusades and jihads. `descr_settlement_mechanics.xml`: each line of the town
  scrolls - population growth, public order, income - with its weight, min and max (cities and castles apart).
  `descr_diplomacy.xml`: what each offer costs and how it moves standing. `descr_recruitment.xml`.
- **Rome under REX** - `descr_settlement_mechanics.xml`: the people each settlement level starts with, needs to grow,
  and holds at most; the weights of the town scroll lines.
- **REX / M2EX** - `descr_unit_sizes.txt`: the Unit size choices in the options (soldiers x this number).

**Find** looks through every file. A value that differs from the game's own shows the game's beside it, with
**Reset**. Change values, **Preview**, then **Write it in**: only the value itself changes in the file (the rest
stays byte for byte), with a backup - Tools > Restore a backup undoes it. A mod without its own copy of a file gets
the game's copy with your changes. The game reads the rules on the next start.

## Add-ons

![Add-ons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterOogwayHomebrew/RTW-M2TW-Campaign-Editor/main/docs/images/addons_sack_settlement.png)

The **Add-ons** button beside the editors lists ready-made scripts that add something new to the game. Pick the
settings, **Preview**, **Put it in** - a backup is made first. **Update it** changes the settings later, **Take it
out** removes it.

### Sack Settlement (Rome + REX)

A 4th choice on the capture scroll, under Occupy / Enslave / Exterminate. The town is exterminated the game's own
way, every building except the chains you keep is torn down, you get a reward per building and per inhabitant, and
the ruins go to the rebels with a garrison the game raises itself (from the region's rebel type). Land you do not
want to hold is burned and left to regrow.

- **Who may sack:** only the player (default), everyone, only factions without a town of their own (hordes), the
  player and hordes, only the computer, or the factions you pick. A computer faction allowed to sack does it
  whenever it exterminates a town.
- **Building chains never torn down:** the governor's building (it must stay), walls and roads by default -
  **Pick...** lists the mod's own chains.
- **Rebel units if the game raises none:** **Pick...** lists the mod's own units.
- **The 4th button** off: Exterminate asks Yes / No to sack instead. Button text and tooltip are yours to change.

It is a REX module (`script/modules/sack_settlement.nut`): REX loads it when the campaign starts, whatever mod runs.
The game's log (`system.log.txt`) then says `[SACK] Sack Settlement module loaded`. Plain Rome has no scripts - the
add-on does nothing there.
