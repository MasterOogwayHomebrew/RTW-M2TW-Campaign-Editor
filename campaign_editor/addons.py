"""Add-ons: ready-made scripts that bring the game something new, put in with their settings chosen in the tool.

An add-on is a Squirrel module (script/modules/<name>.nut - REX (Rome) and M2EX (Medieval II) both require() every
file there once the campaign is up, whatever mod runs). Besides the built-in ones, anyone's .nut can be added
(Add an add-on...): it is kept in the tool's own folder (addons/), its settings found by themselves, and Share...
packs it as a zip for others. Its settings are the 'local NAME = value' lines at the top of the file; the tool writes
the chosen values into those lines and nothing else, so a later version of the add-on keeps the same shape.
Installing and removing go through a Plan like every write: a backup, and Restore undoes it."""
