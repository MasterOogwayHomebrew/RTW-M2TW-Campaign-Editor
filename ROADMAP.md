## 🗺️ Rescale the whole campaign map 3 x

**Bigger map (x3)...** (top row) (beta), Rome (REX) and Medieval II (M2EX). Each tile of
`map_regions.tga` becomes a 3 x 3 block; everything tied to the map is converted with it:

- **Positions** (`descr_strat.txt`, `descr_events.txt`, ...): towns, characters, fleets, resources, forts,
  watchtowers, wonders and event places go to the middle of their new block.
- **Coast and borders**: natural - the coastline winds with bays and capes and the borders between regions wind
  too, instead of 3 x 3 squares and straight 45-degree cuts (two waves whose sizes stand in the golden ratio bend
  them, so the pattern never repeats; the same map always comes out alike); every block's middle keeps its old
  value, so nothing changes under a town, army or resource, and every region stays in as many pieces as before. Ports stay on the shore pixel of their own region.
- **Heights**: `map_heights` the natural way - bent with the ground, crags on the mountains, rivers in their
  valleys, no slope steeper than the old map's steepest - along the new coast, and
  **`map_heights.hgt`** - the game's float copy, which it reads instead of the picture and never rebuilds - written
  at the new size too. The hills, mountains and sea floor are made **3 x higher** (`max_land_height`,
  `min_sea_height` in `descr_terrain.txt`): the land is 3 x wider, so the slopes stay as steep as they were
  (or keep the old heights - a choice in the window). The sea ground types follow the heights' new coast.
- **Rivers**: 1 pixel wide (the game crashes on a 2-pixel river), drawn the way rivers run - bends rounded, gentle
  meanders on straight runs; a river mouth runs on to the new coast and stops there (none on the sea).
- **Beach**: one tile wide along the new coast, as in the games' own maps.
- **Ground and climates by tile**: every new tile the ground type and climate of the old tile it lies in, the edges
  between kinds winding, no 3 x 3 steps.
- **Pictures**: `map_trade_routes`, fog, roughness, disasters and radar maps scaled with exact colours.
- `descr_terrain.txt` gets the new size; `map.rwm` is deleted so the game rebuilds it.
- Preview of every file, one backup, Restore byte-exact.

Scripts follow too: every campaign-map place in the campaign's scripts (spawned armies and characters, `reposition_character`, `move`, the camera, `reveal_tile`, forts and resources made by `console_command`, 'near a tile' and 'in a rectangle' conditions) goes to its block; battle positions in the same scripts stay. Lines the editor cannot read for sure, and Lua / Squirrel scripts, are listed to check by hand.
Without REX / M2EX the original exes stop at
510 tiles - the tool warns. Checked on both vanilla campaigns (103 / 112 towns, 177 / 216 characters, 75 / 77 ports
in place, no river on the sea, every river end at the sea, a river or the map's edge as in the original). The first
alpha (0.24-0.27) left the old `map_heights.hgt` in place and kept the heights - flat, square-coasted maps; make the
map again from a backup with this version. Video of the first alpha: [rescaling the whole map](https://youtu.be/kkfI-WulRmU).

## Where it started

Version 0.1: a small script for one mod (Barbarian Empires REX on Rome: Total War) that cloned a faction
from a template - texts, units, buildings, start towns, leader. Rome only, command line first.

## The road so far

The first nine days (0.1.0 → 0.30.0): from a one-mod faction cloner to a campaign editor for two games.

## What it does now (0.33.0)

### Factions
- ✅ New faction from a template: names, texts, colours, units, buildings, cards, name lists, traits, art *(in-game ✓)*
- ✅ Faction limit known and raised (REX / M2EX `max_factions`) *(in-game ✓ on Rome + REX)*
- ✅ Edit an existing faction: names, texts, colours, AI, money, playable, towns taken or given, capital, leader and heir *(in-game ✓)*
- ✅ Garrisons and buildings per town, with the game's own cards and pictures *(in-game ✓)*
- 📦 Settlement level and population (the governor's building follows the size)
- 📦 The rebels edited like any faction: armies, fleets, garrisons, towns, units (each rebel with its `sub_faction`)
- 📦 Diplomacy: attitudes and starting relations with every other faction
- ✅ Roster: give or take units and building levels (ownership, recruit lines and cards kept in step) *(in-game ✓ Rome + REX: a barbarian archer given to the Julii is recruited in their town)*
- ✅ A separate mod folder in one click (the base mod stays untouched) *(in-game ✓)*

### Campaign map
- ✅ The map drawn tile by tile from the game's own map files; political, diplomacy and region colours *(in-game ✓)*
- 📦 Characters on the map: drag to move, new armies, agents and fleets placed by clicking
- ✅ Move towns and ports (roads and sea routes follow) *(in-game ✓)*
- ✅ Paint new regions and move borders *(in-game ✓ on HLR)*
- 📦 Edit a region's data (builder, rebels, tags, triumph, farming), new or existing
- 📦 Map changes, new regions and faction changes written together by one Apply
- 📦 Resources placed, moved and removed; religions per region (Medieval II)
- ✅ Terrain editor: paint ground types, rivers, fords, river sources and cliffs tile by tile *(in-game ✓ on Rome and Medieval II; [video](https://youtu.be/z0T723riXaU))*
- ✅ Terrain editor: heights brush like a spray can - raise, lower, smooth, level (`map_heights.hgt` kept in step) *(in-game ✓ on Rome and Medieval II; [video](https://youtu.be/mTdRAWympuw))*
- ✅ Find on the map: towns, ports, armies, agents, fleets, units, forts, resources *(in-game ✓ on Rome and Medieval II; [video](https://youtu.be/6WAdnGovGzA))*
- 📦 Terrain editor: paint climates (`map_climates.tga`, the mod's own climates)
- 📦 Rivers kept joined side to side (the game stops a river at a corner-only step); Preview names a river the game will not draw
- ✅ Settlement names by the owner's culture (REX / M2EX rename a town when it changes hands); the map shows the new owner's name at once; every town's names in one table *(in-game ✓ on Medieval II with M2EX; [video](https://youtu.be/umwRyWkHoDE))*
- 📦 Big maps load (a tester's map of 5456 x 2464 tiles)
- 📦 Forts and watchtowers shown on the map; no one is placed on them
- ✅ Make the campaign map 3 x bigger (beta): everything on the map moved with it, rivers 1 pixel, the relief smooth *(in-game ✓ alpha; [video](https://youtu.be/kkfI-WulRmU); Rome with REX, the newest rules: in-game ✓ from a report)*

### Characters
- 📦 Character editor for any faction: names, ages, traits with levels, ancillaries
- 📦 A faction's own name list (men, surnames, women) typed in three steps
- 📦 Family tree drawn like the game's (couples, children, leader and heir); give a wife, add a child, rename (followed on the tree)
- 📦 Portraits on the tree as the game shows them; Medieval II characters get portraits of their own
- 📦 Portrait library: every portrait of a culture, add new ones (sized and numbered for the game)

### Units, buildings, art
- 📦 Unit and building editors: every line as a field, add / remove lines, copy as new, renames followed everywhere
- 📦 Pictures imported into the right place in the right size and format (cards, building pictures, faction art)
- 📦 Medieval II recruitment (`recruit_pool`) and REX's retrain-only lines read and written everywhere
- 📦 REX's bracket requirements: several faction groups on one line, each with its own conditions
- 📦 Unit editor: REX's unit abilities ticked with their effect in plain words (morale, fatigue, charge, terrain, garrison, shield piercing...)
- 📦 Unit packs: export units with models, textures, mounts, cards and texts into a .zip and import them into another mod
- 📦 Medieval II `battle_models.modeldb`: a new faction gets its template's textures in every battle model; unit packs carry their modeldb models (renamed on clashes, textured for every new owner)
- ✅ Faction art: every picture of a faction listed with where the game shows it, Replace... *(in-game ✓)*; a new faction's banners and logo are its own files; Back to the original
- 📦 Rome: the flag symbol on the campaign map and the faction logos, each faction its own, Replace... in the Art tab

### Both games
- ✅ Rome: Total War, Barbarian Invasion, Alexander - plain or on REX *(in-game ✓)*
- 📦 Medieval II and Kingdoms - plain or on M2EX: unpacking offered, set-up fixes, castles, `mods/<name>` with its .cfg
- ✅ Medieval II: turn a settlement into a castle or a city (buildings converted the game's own way) *(in-game ✓ loads)*

### Safety
- 📦 Preview of every file and line before writing; only the lines meant change, the rest stays byte for byte
- 📦 A backup of every write; Restore gives the original back byte for byte (any write and every later one in one go); Undo / Redo in the window
- 📦 Check mod files (consistency report; with a faction picked, every place it is named - game, REX and mod files told apart)
- 📦 Log, Save logs (zip) for bug reports; Light / Dark look; smaller windows keep every button, side panels can be dragged wider

## 📦 Built, comes with the next release

- 📦 New mod folder on the plain game makes a thin mod (only what you change; the whole map folder at the first map change); the editor asks once before writing into a mod it did not make
- 📦 Recolour: an area of like colour painted with one click (a quick select beside the brush)
- 📦 Recolour into black / white looks like the game's own: a battle texture starts from the nearest-coloured faction's texture of the model (the artist's black / white, folds and faces kept)
- 📦 The test mod's report lists the steps to look at in the game first, the ones already seen working below
- 📦 Terrain: Land and sea makes a smooth coast like the games' own (half-tile curve, islets and straits kept); the brush outline follows while painting
- 📦 Map size: no black band after a grow (the fog's frame moves to the new edge); the minimap's border and sea follow
- 📦 Terrain: impassable land, always black (REX / M2EX's impassable_shrouded) - for a wasteland's land hidden for good
- 📦 A bug report carries the list of the mod's files (names, sizes, dates, new / other size than the game's - no contents)
- 📦 A deleted town's region can stay as a wasteland (Rome with REX, Medieval II with M2EX): nobody's land, no neighbour grows; right click its land to give it its town again; a map cut leaves one too
- 📦 Faster on a big mod: many towns deleted at once (21 s -> under 2 s on HLR), the town window about 5 times faster and smaller (it remembers its size)
- 📦 Map size: a cut that takes a faction's last town takes the faction out of this campaign (it stays in the mod); the cut waits for Apply, so a town given meanwhile keeps the faction
- 📦 A new version of the editor is seen on every start (and every 6 hours while it is open): the GitHub button turns green with its number

## 🧪 Being tested in the game now (newest first)

- 🧪 A region with no town of its own (the game's rebel village): its town window writes the town for an owner picked (the rebels too); Edit region shows and changes the owner (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Sack Settlement (Medieval II): the Raze button's words in the game's own Verdana, no hover text, the capture scroll one button taller (the button stays under Exterminate if the game keeps the size); Avoid Growth's words in Verdana too (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Merge regions on the map (both games): click the region that stays, then its neighbour that goes - its land joins the first, everything tied to it follows (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Many towns deleted with their regions at once (the map's Select, both games): each region's land to a neighbour that stays, shown on the map (red goes, yellow takes land, green could) - a click picks another neighbour; one write, one Undo (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Map size by dragging the map's edges (both games): out adds deep sea, in cuts tiles off (shown dark); what stands on the part cut off is ringed red on the map and goes with the cut after a question (family members move to their faction's nearest town) (0.33.0)
- 🧪 A new religion from nothing (Medieval II, Barbarian Invasion): its symbol drawn by the editor, temples of its own made from nothing (0.33.0)
- 🧪 A new building from nothing (both games): say what it is for and how many levels, every line written with the mod's usual numbers for such buildings; levels side by side, any effect the mod uses, the units it trains, plain pictures drawn (0.33.0)
- 🧪 A new unit from nothing (both games): say what kind it is, the editor writes every line with the mod's usual numbers for such a unit; you set each one, its model, owners, where it is trained; plain cards drawn when you have none (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Your own files for a unit's battle model (both games): your texture (every faction or one), Medieval II's weapons texture and your own .cas / .mesh put in, converted, named and written; a model of its own when other units share it (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Module builder: WHEN 'the player's turn starts (once a turn)' - the default for new modules; 'every faction's turn starts' says plainly that it comes for each faction (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Fix: Recolour never writes over an original battle texture - it copies it, recolours the copy and points the faction's line at it; a faction with a texture but no weapons texture gets that line (Medieval II men like bare skeletons in battle), Load offers it for the whole mod (0.33.0)
- 🧪 A town's own garrison with no captain (`garrisoned_army` in the town's block - some mods use it for every town): read, shown in the town window and the garrison editor, changed in place, checked (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Fix: closing the editor never ends in a Windows error box (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Unit cards and building pictures as the game shows them, in every window (one lookup for all; checked over every unit and building of Rome, BI and Medieval II) (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Start the game names the mod it starts (amber without one); the test mod is offered to be started at once; its modules act only in the test mod (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Avoid Growth: only on the Construction tab, in Rome looking like Automanage; forts and watchtowers keep a tile from towns and from each other (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Fix: plain Rome is never given a faction that starts dead (the game stopped reading descr_strat there: empty rebel towns, no diplomacy) (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Fixes: painting on the Terrain tab right after Apply; ports for regions without one; an add-on's old copy outside script\modules is shown, moved or taken out (0.33.0)
- 🧪 Module builder: ELSE, all / any / none of the conditions and NOT, FOR EACH town / army / faction - the control blocks of Scratch (0.32.0)
- 🧪 Module builder looks like Scratch: coloured blocks dragged into each other (the old lists one click away) (0.32.0)
- 🧪 Edit faction > Rename...: a faction's code name changed in every file at once (0.31.0)
- 🧪 Hover a unit or a building in any list: its card; a click on a column heading sorts any table (0.31.0)
- 🧪 One language in every window (Preview / Write it in / Keep for Apply, Enter and Esc, answers in words); the right mouse button takes things out of lists (0.31.0)
- 🧪 Backups: one put back is deleted (no more `_restored` folders); Settings can delete all of a mod's backups (0.31.0)
- 🧪 Every window keeps its changes for one Apply (Mercenaries, Events, Campaign rules, Traits, Many towns, Recolour) (0.31.0)
- 🧪 Mods that hold only the files they change load (the rest read from the game's data, as the game does); changes go into the mod as its own copies (0.31.0)
- 🧪 Fixes from the in-game test runs: Medieval II diplomacy written in its own form (and old lines put right on Load), new texts seen in Medieval II (the old compiled `.strings.bin` taken away), Module builder message pictures, BI bad harvests and watchtowers follow their regions, Sack Settlement ignores revolts, storms only at sea (0.31.0)
- 🧪 One write for the session: the town and character windows keep their changes for Apply; one Apply writes everything waiting; Undo takes back the last part or the whole write (0.30.1)
- 🧪 Fixes: Module builder / Add-ons on a Medieval II game with packed data; a long set-up list on Load scrolls and closes (0.30.1)
- ✅ Religions in Barbarian Invasion: a new belief (`descr_beliefs.txt`, its pips and texts); the test mod gives it temples of its own (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓ from a tester)*
- 🧪 Bigger map (x3): the values in fields of their own (heights, smoothing of the lines, narrow rivers, crags, valleys, volcanoes) with their defaults, what was tried, and a reset; the shore by the water the games' own (no teeth on diagonal coasts) (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Map > New army: Make him a general (his bodyguard leads the army) (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Discord, YouTube and GitHub buttons; GitHub shows the number of a newer release when one is out (`GitHub (new 0.30)`); Settings and Help now in Tools; the bottom buttons wrap on a narrow window (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Credits - a page and a window that thank everyone who made the editor with us: testers, ideas, supporters ([CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md)) (0.30.0)

- 🧪 Map editor: delete a town with its region - its land goes to a neighbour, every file that ties them follows (descr_regions, descr_strat, mercenaries, win conditions, music); what would break the game is refused in plain words (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Map: Select - a box round many things at once, as in a strategy game: give the towns, add a building or garrisons, take characters, resources and forts off the map (0.30.0)
- 🧪 The town window has the Buildings and Garrison editors of the main window, for any town (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Module builder (both games): your own add-on made of WHEN / IF / DO blocks picked in plain words, no code - the mod's own names, nine examples, settings for the player, Put it in / Share (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓ on Rome + REX, Barbarian Invasion + REX and Medieval II + M2EX: money and messages given, loot for a town taken - from the in-game tester)*
- 🧪 Module builder: every event, condition, console and campaign-script command of REX / M2EX (from the engines' own lists, with a search and the parameters as fields) and numbers kept between turns (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Add-on Avoid Growth (both games): a tick on your town's scroll in the game's own look - the town keeps at most the people it has, may shrink and grows back to that (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓ on Barbarian Invasion + REX: a town ticked and held at its ceiling - from the in-game tester)*
- 🧪 Test mod: every campaign rule changed in one step (Medieval II 548 values, Rome 162), the game must read them all (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓: Medieval II + M2EX read all 546 values and played 11 turns, Rome + REX played 10 - from the in-game tester)*
- 🧪 Sack Settlement (both games): the governor's building always stays, 600 people at least in the ruins (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Sack Settlement for Medieval II (M2EX) as a button of the game's own kind: the same script as Rome's, drawn from the scroll's own button pieces in the game's font; the older Lua copy taken out (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓: the button on the capture scroll - from the in-game tester)*

- 🧪 Drawn garrisons fit the town: only what its own buildings recruit, else the cheapest units (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Factions that appear later: by an event, as a faction's shadow (civil war) or splitting off in a revolt - New faction and Events... (from Discord) (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓: the shadow way on Medieval II + M2EX and Barbarian Invasion + REX; the split-off way and the event way on Medieval II + M2EX - from the in-game tester)*
- 🧪 A double click on a town opens its own window (owner, city / castle, level, population, buildings); many towns made city / castle and of another level at once (from Discord) (0.30.0)
- 🧪 REX / M2EX: no faction limit - max_factions raised by itself with every new faction (0.30.0)

- 🧪 Unit and Building editors: Every line of the block opens in a window of its own (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Events: new ones put in date order (the games read them as a queue - a new Rome event never came), 'turn N, year X' beside each date; a historic event always gets its text (0.30.0)

- 🧪 Map editor: the map alone, no faction to pick - drag and give anything of any faction, any army's units (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Stability for 0.30: one mouse-wheel handler for the whole window; going back to an older version never breaks on what a newer one wrote; the exe checks itself before it is handed out; a full disk, a too-long path, no rights or a file held by the game said in plain words with nothing lost (Restore runs again); no internet never hangs anything; a mod with only its changed files explained on Load; a step left over from a closed window can no longer call a new one; the code checked with Ruff before every build, files read in passing closed at once (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Medieval II banners: every look of the small pennants dyed, no seam on the cavalry banner (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Module builder: the engines' builds of 2026-10-04 - a faction made another's protectorate or client (0.30.0)
- 🧪 A faction that lives without towns (REX / M2EX's `can_homeless`), a tick in How a faction comes into the campaign - written right before `can_sap`, after the horde's last unit (0.30.0) *(in-game ✓: the line read by Rome, Barbarian Invasion and Medieval II - from the in-game tester)*

- 🧪 Is this faction complete? (Check mod files with a faction picked): every file that names every other faction but not this one (0.30.0)
- 🧪 Map size: grow the map at any edge by whole tiles (deep sea) or cut it; towns, armies, resources, events and scripts move with it (0.30.0)

- 🧪 Check mod files lists the problems worst first, by when the game would meet them, each with a button to the place that fixes it (0.30.0)

- ✅ The bigger map keeps the rules of the games' own maps: one coast for regions and heights, every town with its own region round it, every port on a coastal land tile, ground types and climates by tile (forests stay forests), land bridges unbroken (from five reports on Divide and Conquer) (0.29.2) *(in-game ✓ Rome + REX, vanilla campaign played)*
- 🧪 A new faction gets its faction-select buttons and the template's other pictures - also when the template's name holds `_` (greek_cities) or its pictures lie only in the game's data (from a report) (0.29.2)

- 🧪 A mod's engine settings (`descr_ex.txt`, `descr_caps_ex.txt`) read from the mod alone, as REX / M2EX read them (0.29.2)

- 🧪 Raze Settlement for Medieval II (M2EX): a 4th button on the capture scroll, the ruins to the rebels (0.29.1; replaced by the button of the game's own kind - see above)
- 🧪 Fixed: a new Medieval II faction keeps its template's AI rule set (`ai_label`) and money every turn (`denari_kings_purse`) (0.29.1)

## 🔜 Next

| Step | What it needs |
|---|---|
| Signed exe (no browser / SmartScreen warnings) | SignPath Foundation's answer (applied) |
| Missions editor (Medieval II / M2EX): the council's and the Pope's missions made and edited - every field, condition and reward | Time; in-game tests |
| The whole Rome campaign moved onto the Barbarian Invasion engine in one click (religions, hordes, night battles for Rome) | Time; in-game tests |
| Diplomacy: a faction that starts as another's vassal (`client_of`, REX + M2EX; the engine setting switched on by itself) | Time; in-game tests |
| M2EX monster units (`descr_monsters.txt`) and campaign voice lines per unit | The format from the engine's authors |
| Terrain: mountains and hills kept in step with the heights (a mountain tile raises the land) | Time; an in-game test |
| Terrain: a tilted 3D view from the heights and ground (asked on Discord) | Time |
| Terrain: a new climate of one's own | Time; in-game tests |
| A new campaign map from scratch (one region, one faction, loads in the game), then grown in the editor | Time; in-game tests |
| The bigger map, after the alpha: plains really flat and mountains with sharp peaks (heights follow the ground type), clean coasts; grow or cut the map's edges | Time; in-game tests |
| Faction packs (like unit packs); building chains as a .zip to share | Time; then an in-game test |
| Mods made on the plain game (slimmed folders) loaded with the game's data behind them | Time |
| Check mod files: the crash rules modders documented (undeclared ai_label, religions not summing to 100, a region with no town not last, event texts, antitraits, dead ancillaries, absolute paths, a town touching another region) | Time |
| Limits shown up front on the original exes (REX / M2EX lift most): units (500), building chains (64 Rome / 128 Medieval II), levels (9), religions (9) | Time |
| A religion of one's own, step by step in its own window: name, symbol, text, its temple chain (levels, pictures, effects like the Building editor), which factions follow it - Medieval II and Barbarian Invasion (BI's `descr_beliefs.txt`, `religious_belief` in the buildings); greyed on plain Rome, which has no religions | Time; BI's campaign files for the test |
| A faction brought over from Rome into Barbarian Invasion (or between any two Rome mods): a faction pack - its units already go over as unit packs | Time; then an in-game test |
| Saved games edited (money, characters, towns of a running campaign), if the save files can be read safely - to be researched first | Research: the save format of both games |
| The window in other languages, picked at the first start: Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Turkish (asked on Discord); hover texts in place of long labels so longer words fit | Time; translators to check the words |
| More of REX's settings in plain words (sprites, arrow visibility, fort upkeep, trade fleets...) - the engine files `descr_ex.txt` / `descr_caps_ex.txt` are in Campaign rules already | Time |
| The AI's war plans (`invade_*` in descr_campaign_ai_db.xml) explained in plain words on the Faction tab | Time |
| Open the mod in the game's own campaign-map editor (`REX.exe -strat_ed=a`, M2EX) | Time |
| 3D for everything: buildings, strat-map models, wonders, ships, agents - viewed, replaced and saved (both games); custom models placed on the map, a mode for wonders | Time |

## 💡 Later

| Step | What it needs |
|---|---|
| A culture of its own (buildings, settlements, sounds, and optionally its own interface look - the panels' pictures in `ui/<culture>/interface`), made like a faction clone from a template culture | Whether REX / M2EX limit the number of cultures (HLR runs 11 under REX); the custom-battle culture list is fixed in the game |
| A new campaign-select map drawn from the faction's towns (built in 0.4, put away for now - the original map stays) | Its look checked in both games' start screens |
| Roads and trade routes: see where the game lays them after a new town or port, warn where no path can run | How the engines lay them; in-game tests |
| A **clean faction template**: a new faction without the template's own rules and triggers (the Senate, the Pope, crusades, hordes, scripts), its flags and symbols made white to paint | A list of each game's faction-only rules, agreed first |
| Rome characters with portraits of their own | Whether REX reads a `portrait` line |
| **Borders drawn by the tool**: natural region borders that follow mountains, hills and rivers; new regions generated in an area | How map tools of other games do it; in-game tests |
| **A smaller map** (the reverse of 3 x bigger): the land and heights first, then towns, ports and resources placed back by priority (big towns and capitals stay), regions merged, factions left to the modder | The tool-drawn borders first |
| **A campaign map from the real world**: pick an area on a world map (e.g. Italy or Sicily), get land, sea, real heights, rivers and climate in the game's format; optional real town names and borders filtered by the map's scale; every step generated or drawn by hand, any step skipped | Open map data (OpenStreetMap, GeoNames, SRTM / Copernicus heights, climate maps); the tool-drawn borders first |
| **Rome Remastered: to be looked into** - whether the editor can work with it too. Nothing promised: first we find out if it is possible | Its files checked against the classic Rome's (most text files kept their old form; mods, packed models and pictures are new); the game to test on |
